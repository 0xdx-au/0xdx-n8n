# 🚀 Push to Remote Repository

## Setup Remote Repository

To push this project to a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), follow these steps:

### 1. Create Remote Repository
Create a new repository on your preferred platform:
- GitHub: https://github.com/new
- GitLab: https://gitlab.com/projects/new
- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/repo/create

### 2. Add Remote Origin
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME with actual values
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/0xdx-n8n.git
```

### 3. Push to Remote
```bash
# Push all commits and set upstream
git push -u origin master
```

## Alternative: SSH Setup
If you prefer SSH authentication:

```bash
# Add SSH remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/0xdx-n8n.git

# Push with SSH
git push -u origin master
```
