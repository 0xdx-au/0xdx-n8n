## Security Best Practices

### Container Hardening
- Use minimal base images (Alpine or distroless)
- Regular security updates and patching
- Remove unnecessary packages and utilities
- Implement proper user permissions
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- API key rotation policies
- Session management and timeouts
- Audit trail for all administrative actions
